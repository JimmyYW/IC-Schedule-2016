some useful commands

git add <filename>: stages file for commit. use -A to add all
git status: see files you have modified and staged
git log (--pretty=oneline)
git checkout <filename>: reverts to file state from git
git reset HEAD <filename>: unstages file, but does not alter it
git revert [COMMIT HASH NAME]: undo the commit and get to the previous commit state
git rm <filename>: remove file from add list (need to do if you use the command line!)


BRANCHING!!

git checkout -b <newbranchname>: create new branch
git checkout <branchname>: switch branches
git merge <branchname>: merge <branch> INTO current working branch
git branch: list all branches

good branch etiquette: everything in master is stable, everything on dev is merged from individuals' feature branches before being reconciled and merged to master
